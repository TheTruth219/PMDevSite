Users log into the platform and vote in a binary fashion on celebrities and brands. The benefit of going binary was to be able to get more data in a straight-forward way from users. In order to prevent bad actors, or people logging into the system attempting to manipulate the voting pool, we created a system called BBV or Balanced Binary Voting. This ensured that as the product scaled and opinions became more diverse, we could spot bad actors much more quickly and ensure the fidelity of our feedback."

Celebrities and companies have a major impact on our day to day lives, and it only seemed fitting that the public be able to have a say so about people and brands that have that type of influence. Ultimately the goal was to create a central platform that was fed by public sentiment for celebrities and companies to be able to gauge the public sentiment of their brand.<br/><br/> We were able to validate the idea and concept with a few PR contacts working at industry leading firms in Los Angeles. We developed our original design and tested it in the wild at a conference, and were able to validate the need for an alternate user experience to expedite the time it took to get users logged in to vote. The roadmap initially had an app budgeted for, but interviews, and research into the user-flow and personas ultimately didn’t support that experience.<br/><br/> In the end we arrived at an api driven solution that would cut down on our marketing spend by leveraging existing audiences on blogs and publications.

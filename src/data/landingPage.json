It provides dimension to problems that most see flat. Development and Product Management are such creative worlds to me. Throughout my journey I've done work for agencies, large corporations and consulted for startups. I've been fortunate to have a seat at the table collaborating with many knowledgeable and talented people, building products for both business and consumer use. You can find me at any given time either engineering design or growth."

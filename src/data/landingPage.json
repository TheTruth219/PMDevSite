            "About": "I believe creativity is a superpower in the business world. It allows you to see in color things that most others would see in black in white. It provides dimension to problems that others may see as flat. I donâ€™t think we celebrate it the way we should as a culture, and as a result- we tend to not be able to problem-solve in creative ways.Development and Product Management are such a creative endeavors to me. I have a professional background in Audio Engineering and Music Production that allowed to understand how being technical directly empowers vision and execution. I took that with me and applied those concepts to a wide variety of industries, and ultimately I found my home in tech."

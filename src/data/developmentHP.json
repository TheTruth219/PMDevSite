Businesses are offloading that workload into the cloud and the web more and more, and I've become obsessed with the growing importance and how much programming is empowering the average person to take advantage of these emerging opportunities. I've consulted and worked on projects ranging from Lo-Code plugins to enterprise SASS products, managed offshore teams to exacting deadlines, and I've owned the front-end of a 150MM+ award-winning retail business. I'm someone with an insatiable curiosity, always be looking to improve upon and do things better. I put a lot of emphasis on being surrounded by a great team because I think working with great people makes all the difference. With all that said, I believe the developer of today is the entrepreneur of tomorrow."

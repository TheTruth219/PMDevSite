I pride myself on being able to effectively communicate technical challenges to diverse groups and stakeholders. I wake up every day and make an effort to learn something new and I'm comfortable with not knowing everything. I'm also confident in my resourcefulness, and I believe half the battle is choosing the <strong>right</strong> battle."

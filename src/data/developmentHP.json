This allows me to understand business and organizational needs from a unique perspective and makes it a somewhat <strong>seamless </strong> process to work with UX/UI Design Teams. I pride myself on being able to effectively address challenges in clear and concise language for people in the organization that are less technically inclined. I also wake up every day and make an effort to learn something new. I'm comfortable with not knowing everything, but I'm also confident in my resourcefulness. Sometimes half the battle is choosing the <strong>RIGHT</strong>   battle to have."
